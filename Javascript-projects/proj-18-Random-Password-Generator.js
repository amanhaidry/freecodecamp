/* Build a Password Generator App
In this lab, you'll practice using functions by building a random password generator.

Objective: Fulfill the user stories below and get all the tests to pass to complete the lab.

User Stories:

You should create a function called generatePassword that takes a parameter, indicating the length of generated password. You can name the parameter whatever you like.
Your function should return a string which represents a randomly generated password. You should use the following string and different Math methods to help you return a new string with random characters in it: ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789!@#$%^&*().
You should define a variable called password and assign it the result of calling the generatePassword function with a numeric argument that represents the desired password length.
You should have a console.log that logs a single string made by concatenating the message Generated password: and the password variable separated by a space.*/

function generatePassword(len) {
  let chars =
    "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789!@#$%^&*()";
  let pass = "";

  for (let i = 0; i < len; i++) {
    let randomIdx = Math.floor(Math.random() * chars.length);
    pass += chars.charAt(randomIdx);
  }
  
  return pass;
}

let password = generatePassword(8);
console.log(`Generated password: ${password}`);
