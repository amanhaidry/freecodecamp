/*
Implement a Unique Sorted Union
Objective: Fulfill the user stories below and get all the tests to pass to complete the lab.

User Stories:

You should have a function named uniteUnique.
The uniteUnique function should accept two or more arrays as arguments.
The function should return a new array that contains unique values from the argument arrays, in the order they are first found in the arguments. For example, an input like [1, 2, 4], [2, 3, 5] would have an output of [1, 2, 4, 3, 5].
*/

function uniteUnique(...arrays) {
  let result = [];

  for (let arr of arrays) {
    for (let val of arr) {
      if (!result.includes(val)) {
        result.push(val);
      }
    }
  }
  return result;
}
