/* Build a Gradebook App
Objective: Fulfill the user stories below and get all the tests to pass to complete the lab.

User Stories:

You should have a function named getAverage that takes an array of test scores as a parameter and returns the average score.

You should have a function named getGrade that takes a student score as a parameter and returns a string representing a letter grade based on the score. Here are the scores and their corresponding letter grades:

Score Range	Grade
100	"A+"
90 - 99	"A"
80 - 89	"B"
70 - 79	"C"
60 - 69	"D"
0 - 59	"F"
You should have a function named hasPassingGrade that takes a score as a parameter and returns either true or false depending on if the score corresponds to a passing grade.

The hasPassingGrade function should use the getGrade function to get the letter grade, and use it to determine if the grade is passing. A passing grade is anything different from "F".

You should have a function named studentMsg that takes an array of scores and a student score as the parameters. The function should return a string with the format:

"Class average: average-goes-here. Your grade: grade-goes-here. You passed the course.", if the student passed the course.
"Class average: average-goes-here. Your grade: grade-goes-here. You failed the course.", if the student failed the course.
Replace average-goes-here with the average of total scores and grade-goes-here with the student's grade. Use getAverage to get the average score and getGrade to get the student's grade.*/

function getAverage(scores) {
  let total = 0;
  for (let score of scores) {
    total += score;
  }

  let average = total / scores.length;
  return average;
}

function getGrade(score) {
  if (score == 100) {
    return "A+";
  } else if (score >= 90) {
    return "A";
  } else if (score >= 80) {
    return "B";
  } else if (score >= 70) {
    return "C";
  } else if (score >= 60) {
    return "D";
  } else {
    return "F";
  }
}

function hasPassingGrade(score) {
  let grade = getGrade(score);
  return grade != "F";
}

function studentMsg(scores, score) {
  let average = getAverage(scores);
  let grade = getGrade(score);
  let passed = hasPassingGrade(score);

  if (passed) {
    return `Class average: ${average}. Your grade: ${grade}. You passed the course.`;
  } else {
    return `Class average: ${average}. Your grade: ${grade}. You failed the course.`;
  }
}
